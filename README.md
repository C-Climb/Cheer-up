# Cheer-up
A website for when you're feeling down and want to look at some cute cats and dogs!

Created because I was having a bad day and wanted to practice consuming APIs & Express/NodeJS. I learned alot during this project and hopefully I can apply some of that knowledge in my next one, which is going to be quite a bit bigger!
